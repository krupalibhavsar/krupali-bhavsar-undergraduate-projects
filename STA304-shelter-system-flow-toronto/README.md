# STA 304: Shelter System Flow in Toronto

Homelessness is prominent in the city of Toronto with 30 in every 10 000 people experiencing homelessness, with this comes the importance of tracking shelter usage to ensure an adequate means of measuring the progress towards reducing homelessness across the city. Data was obtained from the Toronto Open Data portal and was studied using tables and graphs. The city of Toronto has a long ways to go in their methods of both researching and aiding the homeless community. With better data and sufficient research, adequate plans can be put in place to aid the situation and reduce the population of homeless people in the city of Toronto.
